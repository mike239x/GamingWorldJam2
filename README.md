# Mr. Nightshade

A very small top-down hack-n-slash where you go to the dream-world and fight nightmare creatures.

You can use WASD to move, E to interact, Q to switch weapons.
The game can be won, but if you need hints - look in the `spoilers` folder.

Made for the [GamingWorld jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/gw-december-game-jam-2), where the main topic was "dreams".
You can play it online on [itch-io page](https://mike239x.itch.io/mr-nightshade), however beware - in HTML version there is a large lag spike after you hit the first enemy... I think the gpu particle system takes a while to compute for the first time.
Also there might be a post-mortem dev-log on itch-io.
